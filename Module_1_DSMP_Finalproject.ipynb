        "# **Project Overview**:\n",
        "**Project Description:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Course Management System is a software application designed to manage and organize courses, instructors, and students. The system provides features for course creation, student enrollment, syllabus management, and scheduling.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Project Objectives:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Provide a centralized platform for course management.\n",
        "2. Automate student enrollment and course registration processes.\n",
        "3. Offer a structured approach to syllabus management.\n",
        "4. Enable instructors to manage their courses and students effectively.\n",
        "5. Enhance overall educational experience for students.\n",
        "\n",
        "**System Features:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Course Creation: Create new courses with details such as course name, credit hours, number of lectures, course code, total marks, and instructor.\n",
        "2. Student Enrollment: Students can enroll in courses, and instructors can manage enrolled students.\n",
        "3. Syllabus Management: Instructors can create and manage course syllabi.\n",
        "4. Scheduling: Generate course schedules with lecture details.\n",
        "5. Course Types: Support for different course types (e.g., Programming Fundamentals, Mathematics).\n",
        "\n",
        "**System Components:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Course Class: Represents a course with attributes and methods.\n",
        "2. ProgrammingFundamentals Class: Extends Course Class for programming-specific courses.\n",
        "3. MathematicsCourse Class: Extends Course Class for mathematics-specific courses.\n",
        "4. Instructor: Manages courses and students.\n",
        "5. Student: Enrolls in courses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Technical Requirements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Programming Language: Python 3.x\n",
        "2. Design Pattern: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "3. Abstract Classes: Used for course and instructor classes\n",
        "4. Inheritance: Used for course-specific classes\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Improved efficiency in course management.\n",
        "2. Enhanced student experience through streamlined enrollment and syllabus access.\n",
        "3. Better instructor management of courses and students.\n",
        "4. Scalable and maintainable codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Future Enhancements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Integration with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS).\n",
        "2. Addition of grading and assessment features.\n",
        "3. Implementation of user authentication and authorization.\n",
        "4. Development of a user-friendly interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project provides a solid foundation for a Course Management System, and with future enhancements, it can become a comprehensive solution for educational institutions."
